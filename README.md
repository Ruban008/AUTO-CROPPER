AUTOMATED IMAGE CROPPING

Automated Image Cropping is a DIP(Digital Image Processing)project which has been developed by me from the scratch  to crop out the background by identifying the region of intrest.

This project has been employed by considering the various types of images which includes NORMAL IMAGE , CELESTIAL IMAGE , UV IMAGE and INFRARED IMAGE.

The respective images have been attached with the source code.

NORMAL IMAGE - pic03_anil

CELESTIAL IMAGE - pic15_blackhole

UV IMAGE - pic13_UV

INFRARED IMAGE - pic17_infrared

NOTE: THIS PROJECT INVOLVES VARIOUS DIP TECHNIQUES JUST TO SHOWCASE THE PROJECT TO STAND FOR THE RUBRICS.

WHEN THE CODE EXITS THE CROPPED IMAGE WILL BE DISPLAYING AS AN OUTPUT.

THANKK YOU....
